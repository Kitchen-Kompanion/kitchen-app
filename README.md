# Kitchen Kompanion

*A CMSC434 Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) project for efficient, user-friendly kitchen management and meal planning.*

## About This Project

Kitchen Kompanion is an Android app designed and developed as part of a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course. Our goal is to make kitchen life easier, more organized, and fun by focusing on a user-centered design.

---

## HCI Design Rationale

- **User-Centered Approach:**
  - We did informal user interviews and observations to identify pain in mango kitchens (e.g., goods, food waste, difficulty walking fixtures).
  - The most important tabs in the app (home, stock, shopping, food, settings) reflect real user features and mental models.

- **Interaction Design:**
  - Large, clearly marked buttons and intuitive navigation reduce barriers to users for the first time.
  - Touch-friendly design, swipe/roller functions and visual feedback are used for even interaction.
  - Dialogue and confirmation (e.g., add/remove items) prevents accidental data loss.

- **Usability & Learnability:**
  - Onboarding is minimal: Users can immediately add items and start tracking.
  - Regular iconography and color coding help users to distinguish quickly between categories and features.
  - East and back navigation are always available to reduce the user's disappointment.
